# refugees
This project is a prediction task for predicting yearly refugee flows between countries.

This project is still a work in progress, but a few highlights include:
- data/clean_data.ipynb: this is how the raw data sources are processed.
- notebooks/models/04_ef_RF.ipynb: this combines all the data sources except for google trends and trains a random forest model for the prediction task.
